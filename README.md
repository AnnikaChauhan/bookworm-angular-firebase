# BookWorm | Angular
This was the first project built alone in Angular. It is an Angular App with a Firebase backend attached - all data is currently static but the intension is to add a proper firebase database once I have learnt more about Angular.

This app was build in Angular. To install packages, please type 'yarn install' into the terminal. For Angular instructions see [here](https://angular.io/) or below instructions.

This app is available [here](https://bookworm-angular.web.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
